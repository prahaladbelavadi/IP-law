## Theory of Intellectual Property rights and Central Debate
- Why have Intellectual Property Rights ?
- Basic economics of IP
- Central Debate in IP

> Why have Intellectual Property rights ?
> - Natural Rights theory [France]
> - Person hood theory
> - Utilitarian Theory [USA]

> USC Article 1Section clause 8
> "To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries;"
> [Reference](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/art1.asp#1sec8)

# Utilitarian Basis of Intellectual Property:
- Q> What does it mean ?  
    ```
    A> Intellectual Property is a grant to exclude others from the scope of the right allotted.
    ```
- Intellectual Property is functionalist:
    - A means to an End.
    - Pro invention and Pro discovery
- Influence on Free Market:
    Intellectual Property rights interfere with the free market that needs to be justified functionally.

# Public Goods [Negate Intellectual Property Characteristics]:
    - Non rival:
        - Any body can view / look or use the idea
            - Non limited Tangibility
    - Non exclusion principle:
        - Idea or utility cannot be excluded from being used or implemented.

> Intellectual Property law is a marginal change in the incentive structure
> The goal of the government intervention is biased against inventions and discoveries becoming public goods while fostering competition and regulate(exclusion of specify goods) accordingly.

# Trademarks:
- Protecting trademarks protects investments and goodwill.
    - Goodwill is indicated by positive feelings to underlying source of logos or images.
    - Investments go into creating brand awareness.
    - Investments are made into establishing Goodwill:
        - Reduces Search cost for consumer
        - increases efficiency in marketplace
        - Investment in product goodwill enforces investments to improve product quality

> Alternative Scenario:
    If no incentive was provided to build bran awareness, anybody could impersonate one and other creating a market of low quality goods and services.
    Misrepresentation would cause a flood of cheap and low quality goods and services which would be detrimental to the society as a whole.
###Incentive structure
    [Protecting Trademarks -> Companies protect their goodwill -> Invest in Goodwill -> invest in building higher quality goods -> lower search costs]

# Macro economic Principle
