## Theory of Intellectual Property rights and Central Debate
- Why have Intellectual Property Rights ?
- Basic economics of IP
- Central Debate in IP

> Why have Intellectual Property rights ?
> - Natural Rights theory [France]
> - Person hood theory
> - Utilitarian Theory [USA]

> USC Article 1Section clause 8
> "To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries;"
> [Reference](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/art1.asp#1sec8)

# Utilitarian Basis of Intellectual Property:
- Q> What does it mean ?  

    ```
    A> Intellectual Property is a grant to exclude others from the scope of the right allotted.
    ```
- Intellectual Property is functionalist:
    - A means to an End.
    - Pro invention and Pro discovery
- Influence on Free Market:
    Intellectual Property rights interfere with the free market that needs to be justified functionally.

# Public Goods [Negate Intellectual Property Characteristics]:
    - Non rival:
        - Any body can view / look or use the idea
            - Non limited Tangibility
    - Non exclusion principle:
        - Idea or utility cannot be excluded from being used or implemented.

> Intellectual Property law is a marginal change in the incentive structure

> The goal of the government intervention is biased against inventions and discoveries becoming public goods while fostering competition and regulate(exclusion of specify goods) accordingly.

# Trademarks:
- Protecting trademarks protects investments and goodwill.
    - Goodwill is indicated by positive feelings to underlying source of logos or images.
    - Investments go into creating brand awareness.
    - Investments are made into establishing Goodwill:
        - Reduces Search cost for consumer
        - increases efficiency in marketplace
        - Investment in product goodwill enforces investments to improve product quality

> Alternative Scenario:

    If no incentive was provided to build bran awareness, anybody could impersonate one and other creating a market of low quality goods and services.
    Misrepresentation would cause a flood of cheap and low quality goods and services which would be detrimental to the society as a whole.

### Incentive structure
    [Protecting Trademarks -> Companies protect their goodwill -> Invest in Goodwill -> invest in building higher quality goods -> lower search costs]

# Macro economic Principle

- IP rights allow Supra Marginal economic returns
- Competitive Markets vs Non-Competitive Markets

| Competitive Market: 	| Prices Approach Marginal costs 	|
|---	|---	|
| Non Competitive Market: 	| Prices Rise above Marginal costs 	|

- IP rights are not monopolies.
- Price vs Quantity
    - Difference between competitive equilibrium to (Monopolistic equilibrium to maximize profits)
    - IP rights cater in-between monopoly & competitive equilibrium.
    - Dead Weight Loss:
        The gap between monopolistic or IP rights equilibrium to competitive equilibrium.
## Intellectual Property Cost:

- Monopolization cost: Price difference vs. utility
- Rent seeking
- Racing
- Patent trolls
- Restriction of future innovation
- Significant administrative costs
- Significant legislative costs
- Dead weight societal loss

> Q: Are benefits greater than the incurred costs?

# Components of Patent

## Architecture of patent system
- Administrative Agency (PTO)
- The patent document
- Private Enforcement system (Litigation)

### Administrative Agency (US Patent Office):
    Evaluates applications for compliance with standards of patentability
### The patent document:
    Establishes boundaries of protection & claims
    - requires disclosure
### Litigation:
    Market component determines reward & compensation.
    - Involves full review of PTO grant of rights
    - Could result in the patent owner losing his rights & patent; High risk
### Patent Document:

* Front page: To present to the user, reviewer as much of the critical information as possible in a concise & precise manner.
* All US patents are downloadable from USPTO
* Key components: (on front page)

#### Must Haves:
- Title
- Serial Number
- Date (prior art & priority) Validity
- Issue date ( to become prior art for others)
- Inventor name & Assignee (ownership)
- Contact information of owner
- Technology fields for classification
- Citations for references
- Prior Art
- Abstract (description of invention by inventor)
- Must include diagrams of products to deposit flow.
    If software, flow charts are essential
- Specification:
    Inclusion of every thing on background of technology, problem & solution offered by the technology patent; Detailed description; Use cases or production thoughts of inventor.
#### Claims

- Must be explicit to claim what does and does not fall under the scope of invention
- Claim does not need to explain how to create/ make/ use the invention.
- The incentive for inventor to use vague language is to broaden the scope of claim during litigation.
- There ought to be a balance between broad & narrow patent claims to be open to scope but lesser so to meet standards and not to be dismissed (declared invalid)
- Watch vagueness mustn’t increase search cost.
